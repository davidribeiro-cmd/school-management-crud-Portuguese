💻 CRUD System

During my undergraduate studies at PUCPR, I developed a full-featured CRUD system for efficient data management. The project covers all essential functionalities:

➕ Create new records

📄 Read existing data

✏️ Update information

❌ Delete records

The system was carefully designed considering:

Relationships between entities

Correct cardinalities

Data integrity

This ensures consistency and reliability in all operations, showcasing skills in programming logic, data modeling, and software development best practices.

🎯 Project Goals

The main goal of the system was to provide an environment where users could manage information efficiently and easily, applying concepts of relational databases, input validations, and flow control.

Through this project, I gained deeper knowledge in:

🗄️ Structuring and managing relational databases

✅ Implementing validations and business rules

🖥️ Creating an interactive and intuitive interface for data manipulation

🔄 Flow control and exception handling

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

💡 Results

The system performs all operations accurately, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and data integrity. Additionally, the project helped me strengthen skills in object-oriented programming, programming logic, and data modeling, providing a solid foundation for future professional projects.
